\title{Return the scale factor for the angular distance from the central meridian
in an (unscaled) transverse cylindrical projection}
\usage{
scalefactor_tcyl(ang_dist)
}
\arguments{
\item{ang_dist}{Numeric vector.
One or more angular distances from the central meridian, in decimal degrees.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector, same length as \code{ang_dist}.
}
\description{
The scale factor is the distance distortion in the direction of the
meridians.
In the case of the Transverse Mercator projection (a cylindrical conformal
projection) it holds in any direction.
}
\details{
The formulas applied are for the sphere, hence approximate.

The best known map projection system in this context is the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM), which superposes a central meridian scale factor
of 0.9996.

\examples{
x <- seq(0, 3, 0.1)
y <- scalefactor_tcyl(x)
data.frame(ang_dist = x, scalefactor = y)
