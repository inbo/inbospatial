The goal of `inbospatial` is to share useful R functions for dealing
with spatial raster or vector data. These functions have mostly been
written as part of scientific projects conducted at the Research
Institute for Nature and Forest. Although the scope of some of these
functions might be pretty niche, others may be relevant to the broader
research community.
